# Project-Recycle
Project for LiveTheCode Hackathon
Hello everyone, Welcome to Project Recycle, a website which will 
help to increase recycling of plastic and to minimize its production
We have used MERN Stack to make all the components. Our website is 
capable for generating Bulk Codes for plastic bottles for MNC's. 
Which will be used in fully automated Recycle process in the future.
